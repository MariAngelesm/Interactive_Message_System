# Interactive Message SystemðŸ“˜

Welcome to the Interactive Message System, a simple and beginner-friendly web app that collects and validates user input using JavaScript. It prompts the user to enter their name and age, validates the input, and displays personalized messages based on the results.


## Features

* **Interactive User Input**: Uses prompt() dialogs to collect user name and age dynamically.
* **Name Validation**: Accepts only letters and single spaces between words. Rejects names with numbers, symbols, or multiple consecutive spaces.
 * **Age Validation**: Only allows whole numeric values (e.g., 18, 25). Rejects negative numbers, decimals, or mixed inputs like "18abc".
* **Personalized Messages**:

    * If under 18 â†’ Encouraging message to keep learning.
    * If 18 or older â†’ Motivational message about opportunities in development.
